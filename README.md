## Introduction
### Idea

New born and kids until they become teens are to be monitored with great care. This includes their feeding cycles, pee, poop, sleep time, medications along with innumerous other details. All parents especially those of new born are going through a rigorous, round the clock cycle to manage their feeding and excretion cycles. Managing this information is not easy and at times due to physical and mental pressure people tend to forget. So, we need an easy way to manage all baby details securely and be able to retrieve it on demand while interacting with doctors

### Solution

We will build an application that will provide easy capture of data and retrieval of the critical day to day activities of the babies and kids. The end goal of the application is to be able to talk to home automation tools or using mobile app to capture activity details as when it happens. The application will have easy way retrieve the information and share it with different stake holders, such as doctors, pharmacist, retailers on a need basis. This could also potential help with health care in analyzing baby activities to potential identify illness earlier than itâ€™s too late
